== Description ==
SnapSection is a WordPress plugin that allows you to share a section of your article or blog post quickly. It allows you to copy your page URL and inserts the h3 id attribute at the end, that way any user who clicks the link will be taken directly to this section of your page/post.

== How it works? ==
SnapSection searches for every <h3> (heading3) element on your website's pages and posts and checks if it has an id. If not, it will create an id based on the <h3> text.

With an id, any user can share the link to an <h3> by hovering it and clicking the icon displayed.
