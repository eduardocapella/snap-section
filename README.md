== Description ==
SnapSection is a WordPress plugin that allows you to share a section of your article or blog post quickly. It allows you to copy your page URL and inserts the h3 id attribute at the end, that way any user who clicks the link will be taken directly to this section of your page/post.

== How it works? ==
SnapSection searches for every <h3> (heading3) element on your website's pages and posts and checks if it has an id. If not, it will create an id based on the <h3> text.

With an id, any user can share the link to an <h3> by hovering it and clicking the icon displayed, and the users who access the shared URL will be taken to the section of your post/article.


## Description
SnapSection is a WordPress plugin that enables swift sharing of specific sections from your article or blog post. It appends the `id` attribute of the `h3` element to your page's URL. Consequently, any user who clicks the link will be directed straight to this specific section of your page or post.

## How does it work?
SnapSection scans every `h3` (third-level heading) element across your website's pages and posts, checking for an `id`. If it doesn't find one, it generates an `id` based on the `h3` text.

Once an `id` is assigned, users can share the link to a specific `h3` by hovering over it and clicking the displayed icon. Users who access the shared URL will be directed to the corresponding section of your post or article.
